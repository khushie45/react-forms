# Tailwind Form Clone

I have created this form without using tailwind css in React.

Through this project, I learnt about how to use useState hook in forms. And how does input fields like text, date, email, password works and I also learnt about how to create dropdowns, radiobuttons and checkboxes in React. 

I have used vite for the react setup. For more info: https://vitejs.dev/guide/
