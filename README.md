# Overview
This repository documents my journey of learning about handling forms in **ReactJS** using the React Hook Form library. I've explored the core concepts of working with forms, including form validation, custom inputs, and form submission logic.

What I've Learned
- Setting up **React Hook Form** in a project.
- Creating forms with various input types.
- Validating form input using built-in and custom validation rules.
- Handling form submission and data processing.
- Implementing error messages for better user feedback.
- Styling React components using CSS.
- Switching between dark and light mode

I have used vite for the react setup. For more info: https://vitejs.dev/guide/
